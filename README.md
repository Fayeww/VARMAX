# Short-term Prediction of Multiple Stocks Prices


**Model**

The model I choose to use is VARMAX model. It is the go-to model for multivariate time series. It adds a moving average component to the VAR model, and it can allow for external, or exogenous, variables as well. The components in the VARMAX model are therefore

V for vector indicating that itâ€™s a multivariate model

AR for autoregression

MA for moving average

X for the use of exogenous variables (in addition to the endogenous variables)
